# A Universal Gaming Network

**Abstract.** A decentralized gaming network would extend games' shelf-life, compensate editors fairly and offer gamers a rewarding experience across all platforms.

## Abstract

Gaming currently relies on platforms serving as trusted third parties that process electronic payments, players data and transactions between players. While the system works well enough within each gaming network, it still suffers from the inherent limitations of digital enclaves: payments systems and gamers' data are not compatible across networks. This prevents players from accruing reputation, trading items and managing the same persona across platforms. Another area of improvement is subscription models which would greatly benefit from decentralized payments. Enabling transparent micro-payment or pay per-minute is therefore another goal of this project.

To solve the issues we just mentioned, what is needed is an Ethereum-based decentralized platform connecting every gaming network to one single fabric. This would enable complex and transparent transactions as well as data persistency across gaming networks.

<!-- NOTE, the above needs to be rephrased: There is not an issue with FIAT payments, but as we move to subscription models it can be done better, working across hardware and distributors. The decentralization of some of the payments (could be partial), would allow for better transparency.

Also reputation, storage of game play, etc can be decoupled from the hardware OR software creator / provider. -->

## A Future for Gaming 

### Creating a universal gaming network unlocks a slew of needed features

#### For gamers:

- Playing the same game across different hardware devices
- Paying as you go, by-the-minute or partially
- Controlling one's personal gaming data such as:
    - Progress
    - Reputation
    - Trophies
    - Recorded game play
- Capitalizing on gaming assets that are stored in a decentralized manner, therefore more resilient to hacks and disruptions such as hosting companies going bankrupt

#### For editors and distributors:

- Easily monetizing remixes of one's games via revenue sharing
- Perceiving income from games that have been ported to emulators
- Offering rewards to fan-base through mined pooling of payments

**That vision of a unified gaming experience would propel the industry to a new stage, yet it is very achievable thanks to blockchain technology.**


<!-- Simple version, is What if you could play the same game across different hardware devices, pay as you go, or partially. What if your game progress, reputation, trophies, recorded game play was stored decentralised, so it won't be lost in case of any company dissappearing. What if as a creator you could easily monetise on remixes of your game, and encourage them. What if as a creator you could still get revenue from a game when it has been included in emulators. What if you could "mine" rewards through pooling of payments. What if you could have a network that prevents piracy and encourages payments and collaboration between creators and gamers. -->

## The Problems

This section provides further explanation on what issues a Decentralized Gaming Network would solve.

## On the Gamers' side: a fragmented experience

### Duplicate persona's across platforms

This means players can't port their scores and digital assets across platforms. Their reputation is also fragmented and vulnerable to any change occurring in the siloed platform it depends on.

UGP will offer an account management representing all gamers assets, scores and reputation. That data will be cryptographically secure and store in a decentralized way, thus making players personas persistent across networks.

## On the editors' side:

### Short game shelf life

The average profitability of a video game doesn't extend past a few years. The second stage of their life occurs when they have been ported to emulators. Yet their fanbase remains and would be happy to keep playing the game, [organizing tournaments](http://mashable.com/2017/04/04/underground-street-fighter-tournament/#BJc0SXHnlgq7) around their favorite titles and even supporting updates with small contributions. UGP will make those possible for the editor.

### No revenue in case a clone-game is created

Another common situation is the creation of "clones", that imitate the style of a successful game and are generally not profitable because of the limited level of novelty they bring to the gamers. These duplicates can't be sold at full price but instead benefit from softer pricing models like pay-per-minute or tips. The use of plasma for these types of micro-transaction can be put in place at little to no cost. 

### Licensing

Creating a UGP allows very flexible licensing models based on Smart Contracts, the IP of each game can hence be broken down and monetized:

- Game characters
- Storylines
- Artwork / Assets / Music
- Games remixing / clones (when most of the Games' IP is rehashed by another studio)

With the features enabled by smart contracts, studios can agree to pay each other for the reuse of some assets and define the conditions that need to be met for payments to take place. Once the terms of agreement have been written in a smart-contract, the payments are automatically triggered by the use of the aforementioned assets.

### Piracy

The gaming industry is no exception when it comes to online piracy, a problem made all the more complex as the landscape becomes increasingly fragmented.
- Validators aprove the inclusion of games
- Validators will be both stakers, creators and gamers based on stake and reputation.

### Creators reputation and collaboration

NOTE: can you elaborate on this?

## Gaming universal currency

UGP will provide an Ethereum-based token that will be the basis for the ecosystem's economy.

NOTE: did you think about specifics regarding the currency?
<!-- Decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin already proved they could transform the field of monetary transactions. Sending money over the blockchain is now nearly as immediate as sending an email.
Because UGP relies on the Ethereum blockchain, it inherits Ethereum's properties and intends to provide features based on plasma as well.

## Incentivization

#### Reputation of gamers and creators

UGP will be used by gamers and studios to accrue a cross-platform reputation, making their exploits permanently accessible and in the blockchain.

#### Game rewards

NOTE: care to elaborate? I can't tell the difference between "payment pool rewards" and game rewards.

#### Proof of Play, payment pool rewards (random)

UGP will enable features such as Proof of Play, putting to use Ethereum consensus mechanics to write gamers sessions on the blockchain.

#### Token rewards to join a

NOTE: can you finish the sentence?

## Gamers persistency

Keeping the same persona across games
Must pay to prevent cheating

## New Payment Models

- Plasma enabled payment
- Micro-Payments
- Time-based payments

Note: Payment pools, stake on chain, multi-signature, fees.
