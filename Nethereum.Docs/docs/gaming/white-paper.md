# A Decentralized Gaming Network

**Abstract.** A decentralized gaming network would extend games' shelf-life, compensate editors fairly and offer gamers a rewarding experience across all platforms.

## Introduction

Gaming currently relies on platforms serving as trusted third parties that process electronic payments, players data and transactions between players. While the system works well enough within each gaming network, it still suffers from the inherent limitations of digital enclaves: payments systems and gamers' data are not compatible across networks. This prevents players from accruing reputation, trading items and managing the same persona across platforms. Another area of improvement is subscription models which would greatly benefit from decentralized payments. Enabling transparent micro-payment or pay per-minute is therefore another goal of this project.

To solve the issues we just mentioned, what is needed is an Ethereum-based decentralized platform connecting every gaming network to one single fabric. This would enable transactions transparency and data persistence acro
ss networks.

<!-- NOTE, the above needs to be rephrased: There is not an issue with FIAT payments, but as we move to subscription models it can be done better, working across hardware and distributors. The decentralization of some of the payments (could be partial), would allow for better transparency.

Also reputation, storage of game play, etc can be decoupled from the hardware OR software creator / provider. -->

## A Possible Future for Gaming 


Creating a universal gaming network unlocks a slew of needed features:

For gamers:

- Playing the same game across different hardware devices
- Paying as you go, or paying partially
- Owning personal gaming data such as: progress, reputation, trophies, recorded game play
- Capitalizing on gaming assets that are stored in a decentralized manner, therefore more resilient to hacks and hosting companies going bankrupt

For editors and distributors:

- Easily monetize on remixes of your games via revenue sharing
- Perceive income from games that have been ported to emulators
- Offer rewards to your fan-base through mined pooling of payments

While that vision of a unified gaming experience would propel the industry to a new stage, it is very achievable thanks to blockchain technology.


<!-- Simple version, is What if you could play the same game across different hardware devices, pay as you go, or partially. What if your game progress, reputation, trophies, recorded game play was stored decentralised, so it won't be lost in case of any company dissappearing. What if as a creator you could easily monetise on remixes of your game, and encourage them. What if as a creator you could still get revenue from a game when it has been included in emulators. What if you could "mine" rewards through pooling of payments. What if you could have a network that prevents piracy and encourages payments and collaboration between creators and gamers. -->

## Problem

### The issue with siloed gaming platforms
The current digital gaming landscape is dominated by competitors offering access to titles via siloed distribution systems. Those enclaves don't allow a consistent experience  (reputation portability)


## The Gamers' side: inconsistency and frustration


## The editors' side: 
- short game shelf life
- no revenue in case of clone-game
- emulation

### Licensing
- Games remixing / clones
- Game characters
- Storyline
- Artwork / Assets / Music

### Preventing piracy
- Validators aprove the inclusion of games
- Validators will be both stakers, creators and gamers based on stake and reputation.

### Creators reputation and collaboration

## Gaming universal currency

## Incentivization
+ Reputation of gamers and creators
+ Game rewards
+ Proof of Play, payment pool rewards (random).
+ Token rewards to join a 
## Gamers persistency
Keeping the same persona across games
Must pay to prevent cheating

## New Payment Models
- Plasma enabled payment
- Micro-Payments
- Time-based payments

Note: Payment pools, stake on chain, multi-signature, fees. 


## NOT a new appstore

## Privacy
