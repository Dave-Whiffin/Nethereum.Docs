**Abstract.** A decentralized gaming network would extend games' shelf-life, compensate editors fairly and offer gamers a rewarding experience across all platforms.

## Introduction

Online gaming currently relies on siloed gaming platforms serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments and transactions between players. While the system works well enough within proprietary gaming networks, it still suffers from the inherent limitations of the customer lock-in based model: hardware manufacturers centralize payments and gamers data, effectively sealing participants in a closed-world. These enclosed "game economies" won't allow players to accrue reputation, trade items or simply interact across gaming platforms. Meanwhile, the dominant actors' siloed model hinders opportunities such as micro-payment or pay per-minute because of its reliance on traditional fiat payment systems.

What is needed is an Ethereum-based decentralized platform connecting every gaming network to one single fabric. This would enable interactions across network that wouldn't require validation from any third party.

## Problem

### The issue with siloed gaming platforms
The current digital gaming landscape is dominated by competitors offering access to titles via siloed distribution systems. Those enclaves don't allow a consistent experience  (reputation portability)


## The Gamers' side: inconsistency and frustration


## The editors' side: 
- short game shelf life
- no revenue in case of clone-game
- 
### Licensing
- Games remixing / clones
- Game characters
- Storyline
- Artwork / Assets / Music

### Preventing piracy
- Validators aprove the inclusion of games
- Validators will be both stakers, creators and gamers based on stake and reputation.

### Creators reputation and collaboration

## Gaming universal currency

## Incentivization
+ Reputation of gamers and creators
+ Game rewards
+ Proof of Play, payment pool rewards (random).
+ Token rewards to join a 
## Gamers persistency
Keeping the same persona across games
Must pay to prevent cheating

## New Payment Models
- Plasma enabled payment
- Micro-Payments
- Time-based payments

Note: Payment pools, stake on chain, multi-signature, fees. 


## NOT a new appstore

## Privacy


## Calculations
