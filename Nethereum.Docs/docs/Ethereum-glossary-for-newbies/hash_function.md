What is a cryptographic hash function?
======================================

tl;dr
-----

Cryptographic hash function take an input and convert it into a cyphered
output.

``` {.sourceCode .mermaid}
graph LR
ABCDEF-->|Hash Function|f6674e62795f798fe2b01b08580c3fdc
```

### Detailed explanation

#### Hash functions characteristics

1.  It is practically impossible to re-generate an original message out
    of its hash
2.  The tiniest change in the original message, changes the hash beyond
    recognition.

For example hashes generated from `ABCDEF` and `BCDEF` are totally
different:

``` {.sourceCode .mermaid}
graph LR
ABCDEF-->|Hash Function|f6674e62795f798fe2b01b08580c3fdc
```

``` {.sourceCode .mermaid}
graph LR
BCDEF-->|Hash Function|d74fe0b3aa33802598d68a69bee355e7
```

3.  it is practically impossible to find two different messages with the
    same hash

What are hash functions used for?
---------------------------------

Here are various scenarios involving hash functions:

#### Scenario \#1:

Bob wants to send Alice a message, but he needs to make sure only Alice
can read it. To do that

#### Scenario \#2:

Bob wants to send Alice a message, but Alice needs to make sure Bob is
the actual author of the message.

#### Scenario \#3:

#### Scenario \#4:

Using hash functions in combination with [cryptographic
keys](/docs/Ethereum-glossary-for-newbies/public-private-key.md) anyone
can prove that they own a piece of data without disclosing the data
itself. Indirectly, it proves: That the owner of the data knows their
password. to prove you previously wrote a message rest assured the
message was not altered index your messages

Ethereum uses Keccak-256and Keccak-512.

It is possible to index content by its hash, in essence creating a
hashtable. If you have used IPFS or BitTorrent's magnet links, among
others, then you already used a hashtable.

``` {.sourceCode .mermaid}
%% Example diagram
graph LR
    A[Alice] -- Link text --> B{Circle}
    A --> G(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C[John] --> D
```
