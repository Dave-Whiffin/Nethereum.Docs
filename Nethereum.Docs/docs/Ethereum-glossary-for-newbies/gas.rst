What is Gas in Ethereum?
------------------------

tl;dr
^^^^^

Gas is the internal pricing for running a transaction or contract in
Ethereum. The Gas unit measures the number of computational steps and is
priced in Ether.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to prevent spamming attacks and endless loops (processes that
runs indefinitely), Ethereum makes it costly to run transactions, each
computational step is charged a certain number of *gas*.
