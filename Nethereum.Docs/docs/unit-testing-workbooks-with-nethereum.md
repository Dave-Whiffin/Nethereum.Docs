Workbooks are a great way to learn, but you can now include them in your development workflow by unit testing Workbooks.

Here's a [piece of code](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Workbooks/blob/master/Nethereum.Worbooks.Tests/Nethereum.Worbooks.Tests/NethereumGettingStartedSmartContractsWorkbookTest.cs) developed at Nethereum that will enable Workbook unit testing.

The following will get you up and running with WorkBooks in the context of Ethereum block

### How to get started:

1 - [Install Workbooks](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/workbooks/install/#Download_and_Installation) (MacOS/Windows)

2 - [Clone Nethereum Workbooks git Repo](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Workbooks)

3 - Using Visual Studio, open [this project](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Workbooks/blob/master/Nethereum.Worbooks.Tests/Nethereum.Worbooks.Tests/Nethereum.Worbooks.Tests.csproj) from the repo you just cloned.

4 - Still in the Workbooks repo, start
