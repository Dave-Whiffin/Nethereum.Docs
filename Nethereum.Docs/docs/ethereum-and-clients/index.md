Ethereum Clients
================

To integrate with Ethereum, Nethereum requires an Ethereum client node
like Geth, parity, Quorum etc with RPC / IPC enabled.

Check [here](/docs/Ethereum-glossary-for-newbies/node.md) if you don't
know what an Ethereum node is.

The client might be installed locally, a server you control or be a
public node depending on your needs and use case. For smart contract
development you can also install [Test
RPC](/docs/ethereum-and-clients/test-rpc.md), which provides a very fast
Ethereum simulator with a great feedback cycle.

For example, if you are just interested in retrieving existing data from
contracts, or sending offline signed transactions from the Ethereum
public chain, you can just use a public node like
[Infura](https://infura.io/) without the need to install locally a node
client like [Parity](/docs/ethereum-and-clients/parity.md) or
[Geth](/docs/ethereum-and-clients/geth.md).
